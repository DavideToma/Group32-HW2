## Homework 2 - How do Taxis move in NYC?
![alt text](https://github.com/DavideToma/Group32-HW2/blob/master/photo.jpg)
## What you will find in our repository:
1) **Homework_2.ipynb**: a tidy Notebook where we put the code and the comments of our pipeline.
2) **RQ bonus.ipynb**: we tried to go further with the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) which shows new interesting things on the data set by responding to a further RQ we have created.
3) **Mappa1**: this is the map of New York with the taxi zones.
  [I'm an inline-style link](file:///C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/NYC%20taxi/mappa1.html)
4) **Mappa2018pu**: map of New York about the areas where taxis are picked up.
5) **Mappa2018do**: map of New York about the areas of drop off.
6) **mean_tripduration_NYC.html**: analysis for each borough of the average of trip duration (using Bokeh library).
### We have inserted the *html file* and *RQ bonus* in README because otherwise this file.ipynb was too big to be loaded on github (in this way we didn't run they in the notebook).
